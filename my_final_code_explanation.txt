1) Used word2vec for word embedding
2) trained the model using LSTM with 256 sized hidden state
3) transformed the data using above model by removing the final sigmoid layer
4) built a multilayer perceptron and trained on the transformed data.
5) predicted on transformed test data
6) cleaned up the probabilities in R.
7) manipulated in excel to get the result ready for submission
